1,"More Nepali food!

The chicken momos were perfectly steamed and had a great seasoned minced chicken filling. The tomato/chili sauce was a perfect accompaniment.

The pork and buffalo fried rice - What I have to start of with is that the portion size that I got delivered was absolutely humongous and I mean that four people could've eaten from it - wow.
The pork and buffalo though were overdone and very chewy. Also, the rice was incredibly oily so it was hard to eat.

Another dish I sampled was the chicken sekuwa that is served with a side of veggies and choila (beaten rice).
I like char but this was a little overdone in terms of being acrid and dry. It also lacked a bit of seasoning. The rest of the dish was fine."
2,I called ahead before I ordered on DoorDash to see if they served naan bread with the tikka masala and the woman on the phone said yes. I wanted a side of rice with it and I didn't mind paying the extra I just wanted to make sure that the masala did come with bread so I didn't have to add an order on top of the rice. Then she said that I could just put under the instructions that I wanted both so I wouldn't have to pay extra at all for anything . I really shouldn't have listened to her and payed extra for both the naan and rice but this is my fault for trusting an employee of a restaurant! I then receive my food with double rice and no naan like what am I going to do with all this rice? And then they got a godamn smoothie listed in the menu and I received a mango juice box for almost 5 dollars. If DoorDash didn't pay me back I swear we would've had an issue because this experience was completely unacceptable. If I could give the 0 stars I would !!!
3,"I've never had Nepal food before. We stopped in to try it and everything was delicious. The waitress helped us with some recommendations. I had chicken chow mein and my husband had veg thali. Both were delicious! The chicken momo dumplings were so good! The only thing I would say is it needs some cleaning, but the food was really good! Glad we stopped!"
4,"Despite its appearance and somewhat unclean atmosphere, the Momo here is definitely worth getting it. The food maintained a lot of its moisture and had plenty of flavoring!"
5,"Couple of things to owners
1. Hire friendly people.. staffs not seem to be caring about people they were in their fone while customer
2. It took me almost an hour to get food. The staffs could have informed me that they were out of the things I ordered I could have made other choice but I would have to wait for long time again.

3. 10 stars for sagun she was really friendly but rest all were just clockwatcher.. I have to choose another alternative."
6,"Poor management. The place is understaffed, and the only serving staff there seemed undertrained. The place got busy after we got there, and the server was clearly struggling. We ordered Mutton Thali, and it was under par."
7,"There is no point in staying open till 2am if you guys can't afford to provide service that is consistent with the industry standards.

The meat was uncooked to say the least if we ignore the fact that you served us mutton gizzard.

If you wish to capitalize on customers who would come in till 2am for Indian food then hire some professional chefs and work staff.

For now it just seems like entrapment."
8,"You wanna have typical Nepali momos? This is the best place to be. They are delicious, hot and juicy. They took sometime to be prepared but trust me the wait time was worth it. I wasn't a big fan of the chowmein.
I would recommend the chilly momos and steamed for sure. Also they do not have chopsticks cuz honestly the desi momos you need to have using your fingers or fork!
The place is small and not fancy. Simple and nice to enjoy your food. The food tasted fresh as well."
9,"Had a bad experience with this place. To start, restaurant isn't very clean. Especially the restrooms, where the floor was very sticky plus there was no soap or paper towels. It only made me wonder what the kitchen was like...
Food was mediocre, and something tasted burnt. Naan was at least good though. Service was really bad. Food took a long time to come out. We were completely forgotten about and had to search for someone to get the check. Maybe I came on a bad day, but I most likely won't be back."
10,"Went here for dinner on a Saturday evening around 8:30 or so.  I had called ahead to make reservations but the nice girl on the phone said I didn't need one and she was right, because there were only 4 other people dining.  Anyhow, the nice girl spoke to us in Nepali which really surprised us.  During the whole ordering process, Nepali was spoken, and luckily my girlfriend is better at it than I lol.  They also speak English so don't worry!

I was really in the mood for one thing and one thing only: MOMO's.  These are Nepali dumplings and pretty much one of my favorite foods when done properly.

Buff momo's: greasy and not as good as the chicken momo's, I think it was a bit overspiced but couldn't really figure out exactly why I didn't like it as much as the chicken variety.

Chicken momo's: also very greasy but very tasty as well.

Next time we will try the pork momo's as I think these will be the tastiest of them all.  I will continue to update this review as I try more things since I definitely will be returning here at least once a month!"
11,"I don't understand the previous unfavorable reviews. We found this place by accident on on our last day of vacation, and having never tried Nepali food before, decided to give it a go. Best decision of the day! Only one waitress was working, and despite being pretty busy with the lunch crowd, she was very friendly and patient as we fumbled our way through figuring out what we wanted to try on the menu. We settled on a couple of mango lassis with Mutton Sekuti and Chicken Sekuwa. Both dishes came with rice so we tried beaten rice with one and regular rice with the other, and honestly there was so much food that we could have shared one entree. I'm glad we didn't, though, because trying new things is fun, and I kept stealing bits of mutton from my husband's plate. I was not a fan of the beaten rice and the waitress offered to bring me some regular rice instead, but rather than waste food, my husband traded rices with me. I would love to be able to come back here and try more new things from their menu,  but I don't know when I will be back in Texas."
12,"the only good thing about this place is its open till 2, absolutely disastrous food and service. NO!"
13,"This Place is Awful Especially the Waitress seems really rude and mannerless. The food was not good at all. They served cold food to me although i went there on lunch time around 12:30 PM. Once again, the lady (waitress) was terrible and had attitude problem."
14,"Avoid at all costs! Terrible service, food that is spiced wrongly and possibly spoiled meet, extremely hot inside (and cooler outside the ""restaurant""), and the place is dirty. I really can't understand how this place stays in business, except maybe it's a front for some other sort of business."
15,"Time is precious and I do not intend on wasting my time and yours; therefore, lets start with the bottomline. This place needs immediate intervention by the owners, or it needs to shut down before it brings further shame upon face the Himalayan hospitality and Nepali reputation.
We went to this place like four times and on every single occasion the server never failed to disappoint us. Food was okay, but it is utterly pitiful when you spend about an hour to 90 minutes inside a restaurant and nobody ever comes back and refills your glass with water. On every single visit there, we had to raise our hands and request our glasses be refilled, that's after waiting for about 20 minutes. how can you lack such common sense? These servers will never make eye contact with you with hopes that once you do make eye contact, you'll have to ask the customers if they want anything, and they'll never come back to your table. this is ridiculous and lets shut down this place.
Dirty, hot, and zero management. The waitresses have no sense of hospitality. I would rather recommend going to other Nepali restaurants around this area. This place is not worthy of your precious time or money."
16,ordered to go and received stale momo/dumpling. i could tell that the dumplings were from the night before and simply reheated. plenty of choices around for this kind of food so buyers beware.
17,"I enjoy coming to this spot its convenient as far as location and food is fair. So far I've tried the veggie lowmein, veggie rice bahini (think that's how its spelled) and soup I wasnt to crazy about the tofu though so that's always pushed aside . As customer service and cleanliness; the girls were friendly and let you sit where ever and continued to check if we needed anything.  Restuarant I like the set up and everything looked up to date, but I didn't get a chance to see the kitchen. Also I like their little stage, I'm curious if they have karaoke or special events hmm someone find out for me lol. So far so good no real complaints."
18,"My rating is price vs. taste & quality of food. This place has amazing quality of food with very authentic taste. I tried the chicken thali, every item on the plate was very tasty and fresh. Except for the Chicken, every item can be topped up again. The lady who was serving us was very courteous and prompt.

There were total 8 items in the thali; saag, dry squash curry, dal, papad, cauliflower curry, bamboo shoot curry, chicken curry and rice

2nd visit, very good as expected. Place got renovated and it feels better. Tried veg thali and mutton thali; both came off very nice."
19,Tried the chicken momo and they were delicious tried it with the tomato chili was just a little too spicy for me but good taste.  Just need to improve on the Mango Lassi.
20,"I am a momo lover and this is my go to place in Dallas. Love the Nepalese cuisine here. The food tastes awesome, huge portion for every meal and the staff is so friendly. The portion and quality of the food is unbeatable for the price. Recently they redecorates the place with a small stage for live performance and overall the ambiance has a good vibe now. Would recommend this place for Nepalese food lovers and for momo lovers like me, would definitely keep going back there."
21,"They serve one the finest momos. We were in a group and so tried all varieties of chicken momos. Chili chicken fried momos were the best tasting.

Service and hospitality is very welcoming. I highly recommend this place for momos for anyone visiting Arlington area."
22,"I have now been to this restaurant several time. Food including Thali, Taas, etc. is pretty decent. However, service here is abysmal. I feel like Waiters have never been trained or have much sense for service. For example, the last time we went no one checked up on us till we were done eating. We got our check after paying, Waiter left in our table from some distance. Waiters almost make any eye contact or don't even show that they care. Also, cleanliness is not the best. Our table was clean but underneath the table there was a napkin & other stuff on floor. Seating booths were had some food & seems greasy."
23,"The service was excellent, my brother and I were in for the first time. We asked what was the most popular, I think it was Thali, I had the mutton, my brother had the chicken.  Both were delicious. The server did a great job of walking us through how to eat the dish. We also had some buffalo moo moo dumplings that were outstanding as well.  We have another favorite spot to meet and eat."
24,"Wow, this restaurant was great! I had been hesitant to try it because of some low reviews, but I now see those had to be bogus. The outside is rather unassuming, but as soon as I stepped inside it looks nothing like any restaurant in the area because it was so nice and fancy. I put in a late night order at 1:30 AM. They were still quite friendly and helpful, and my order was perfect. Rice is usually a plain side, but I got some of the best rice I've ever had at almost 2 AM. My mom has always shied away from Indian/Nepalese cuisine. My leftovers the next day smelled so good that she actually asked to try some, and wants to go eat at the restaurant soon. There are a ton of Nepalese and Indian restaurants in this area, and even though I like almost all of them, I have to say that this was instantly my new favorite. This will definitely be in my regular rotation, and I'd recommend giving it a try for yourself!"
25,Went to this restaurant after a while. They redecorated the whole restaurant and now it really looks great. I went there with a friend of mine. The new staff was very friendly and had great customer service. The wait time was very short. We had our food ready in about 15 minutes which I was very surprised by. Highly recommend this place to anyone trying Nepalese cuisine.
26,I had chicken chili mimos...so good! Very friendly staff and all my friends food was so good too!
27,Been coming here for years... food has gotten better these last couple of years.. nice remodeling of inside of the restaurant... Service is little slow .. needs work on that .. overall good place to enjoy some authentic Nepali food.
28,"Been there again with friends in late night. Loved the food this time too, but the live band music was more noisy than entertaining. Usually everyone prefers dinner place to be warm, pleasant, cozy, and less noisy. None of our friends were enjoying the live band music there. I guess others might have the same thoughts. Service was not attentive too because of the same.  Couldn't stay for longer time. Would prefer to go when there is not such sort of noise."
29,"Very good service by ARISHA amazing server 5 stars because of her service they should hire few more people like her great food but above all great service.
Only one request please give an access to free WiFi like other restruants (just a humble suggestion)"
30,"What a shame! These guys are going to hell.
We ordered early cuz we knew that their service was late. The food wasn't ready 15 minutes after we reach there. The waitress was so dumbass, lazy and ignorant that we had to ask for spoon, fork and water after the food arrived. The momo was nasty as f**k. so we wanted to order something else but the bitchass waitress said the cook was angry so we are not taking any more orders.
Shame on owners, shame on workers and the fucking cook and waitresses."
31,"Bad. Very bad service. First the order I made took forever to come and they brought something else. Then after a bite I was out to take a quick phone call and when I came back they took away my food. I had left my keys, wallet but still my food was gone. Now I am hungry and disappointed."
32,"I've eaten here about a half a dozen times, if not more. If you can make it for lunch, they have a pretty good lunch special. The food is good and with good quality but their service needs improvement. Every time I come, I feel like I'm an annoyance and they seem unhappy with my presence.

Last time I came, I decided to do a pick up order because I was on the way home from work. The young lady said 15-20 minutes, which is pretty average timing for most food places.

I show up to their empty establishment and after the lady asked me for the name on my order, she said ""why did you come here so early?"" Before I could think of a response, she said, ""I told you 15-20 minutes. I was caught off guard. I really didn't think that I arrived too early because I work in Farmers Branch and that's a 20-25 minute commute everyday. I asked her if I could use the restroom, to which she pointed the direction without looking up from her task. After that, I patiently waited for about 10 minutes before my order was ready, standing in their restaurant with awkward silence"
33,"We ate Chicken Momos here.It was so delicious and very reasonable price too.
Thank you Himalayan Aroma Family for serving such a nice food here in Irving area.
I recommend Chicken Momos here.
:))))
I am thankful to Manoj Lamsal Bhanja too because he recommended this place.His choice was perfect!!!!!!"
34,This is my favorite Nepalese restaurant. Great quality and tasty Nepalese style food. Service is average but I don't complain because food is awesome. Buff sukiti is a little overpriced but totally worth it. This is my go to place whenever I go to Dallas
35,"Roaches. There are so many bugs in this place. I came to pick up food with my SO, reached for a menu and a roach ran out. So not worth it completely grossed me out."
36,"I happened to stop by here as it was closer to my friend's house. The entrance kind of gets confusing but it's not hard to miss. The place looks like some renovations is taking place. Spacious, readily got seated. The staffs were friendly. We ordered jhol momo and chicken thali. Momo and plenty of achar what would I be needing next but the chicken thali was very delicious, very authentic Nepali taste. The portion size is so generous. The staffs frequently came to check on us and asked if we would be needing more. They will offer extra rice and other vegetables and pickle except the meat dishes. Meat items can be provided with extra charge. That chicken curry was finger licking good. I packed some for home as well. The chicken curry tasted better than curry over Indian restaurant and most Thalia found in other restaurants. A must try thali. I can't wait to taste their more delicacies and wish that soon we will have one of these kind of restaurant in Bay Area."
37,Best  Nepali food in Dallas! Customer Service/Dining area isn't the best but the food is very authentic!  I wish I could visit more often.
38,"Favorite spot for my BF and I. We get the same thing every time--momo and chow mein.

Recently noticed a difference in taste, mainly the chow mein being abnormally spicy. So perhaps they have a new kitchen staff. We told the server and she ran it back and they remade it and it was great."
39,"I usually dont like restaurant momos, but I liked theirs. I have had their jhol, chicken and vegetarian momo and they are all good. On my recent visit, I ordered paneer tikka with naan. They dont make fresh naan, rather use frozen naan from Indian store. Our naan was not evenly heated so it was very hard and cold in some areas. NOT worth it at all."
40,"DO come here and see how great it is yourself. DO NOTTT listen to the horrible yelp reviews. Coming from a non nepali AND a nepali person, this food and also service is amazing!! We had a shorter female waitress who thought of everything, we did not have to ask for a thing. She packed our to gos, gave us so many boxes, refilled drinks, came back to ask if we were okay, she exceeded our expectations. The food is sooo much more affordable than the other nepali restaurants in irving/dallas/arlington and yet quality and taste is not compromised at all. The food was so amazing and authentic to nepali traditional cuisine, yet they were able to modify for me who doesnt like spicy food. 10/10 would recommend, i was put off by all of the horrible reviews but i decided to try it myself and was so glad i did that i took the time to write this good review. PLEASE COME HERE!"
41,Favorite place for late night dinner! They dont disappoint you! An average ambience though. Not for fine dine
42,This is one of my favrioute place yo eat either lunch or dinner. The best one is chiken dumplings called jho  momo. You wont regret eating here.
43,Seriously dont go to this place. Dirty and i found hair and most of others too have got many times. Employee are worst
44,"The chicken thali and the mutton thali are very good.  They have very authentic taste.  For a change tried the pork chilly.  It was deep fried pork in chilly garlic sauce which tastes horrible.  The jhol momo was mediocre.  
The service is PATHETIC.  The server has no idea what is she doing, she didn't even have common sense  to bring two appetizer plates in the table when two people were trying to share pork chilly!  When asked for plates she rolled her eyes. The restaurant wasn't even busy besides us there were two more table of two!"
45,"Great Customer service. The food over there was not that good as expected but it's a great place to have Nepali food for that price. The best thing about it, you can eat authentic Nepali food after midnight too if you're inDallas."
46,"fellow yelpers please don't come here!! i desperately want to give this place a  negative star let me list why;
the restaurant was almost 100 degrees hot and they didn't care to do anything about it.
service was awful. everyone that worked had a terrible attitude
gave our food in paper plates (yup, paper plates)
disgusting food!!! the meat items were old. the chicken in all the dishes i had tasted funky and rubbery. their goat dishes almost made me puke because i took a bite and it tasted like nasty meat that had been sitting out for days.
i warn everyone to avoid this place at all cost. there are so many better nepali places to eat in irving. drive 5-6 mins further and try ramailo instead."
47,"We tried this place with our Nepali friend that wanted us to try a different place than Everest - that we love so much! It's was just down the street, so why not. We went for Saturday lunch - We ordered Mo:Mo's as an appetizer - the fried mo:mo:'s were supposed to come with spicy dipping sauce but they gave us ketchup because the sauce ""was not ready"". Really?
The other fried mo:mo:'s in spicy red sauce were very good, the ones with white sauce were okay.
I ordered Veg Thali and it was just okay. I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. It was just kind of plain. The Paneer Tikka Masala was very good though. A friend ordered chicken Tikka Masala and liked it.

Overall, I didn't like this place as much as other Nepali/Indian places, but still would like to give them 3 stars. The waitress didn't care about us much, had to be called several times. She even didn't ask us if we want to drink anything, so we just had water. Our Nepali friend had to talk to her in Nepali, because she seemed not to be comfortable to speak English."
48,First of all food was awesome and price is very less but maintenance is not good and the worst serving I have seen in any restaurant. Please don't go for dine better to take take away
49,"I went there hoping for a nice, quiet break from the office for lunch. The atmosphere felt like a disco club with the music videos that were playing on television. The restaurant didn't look well kept. The menu is very limited and there are no fresh green salads on it. What I ordered (vegetable soup, steamed dumplings and masala dish) was just ok and nothing to rave about it. I should have just turned around and left, but I didn't have time to go anywhere else. I would like to give this place more stars, but I can't in good conscious."
50,"The food here tastes okay. The reason I'm giving it two stars is because of the service. I've been here several times within the last few weeks and the waitresses we had were some of the worst I've ever encountered. They are inattentive to the customers, play on their phones the whole time, slightly rude, and are overall incompetent. I can understand if the restaurant is busy, but there were literally no more than 4 other people when we were there. It is impossible to get the attention of these waitresses. I was without water for my entire meal and they ignored me when I made eye contact and waved down one of them. Please please get better customer service skills and maybe I'll come back. It's a shame."
51,"You know when you go to yelp to read reviews of a traditional foreign restaurant by an authentic foreigner? Well this is it. My experience has never been this horrible in any food place to ""force"" me to write a review. This is what my mom calls to throw in a garbage can type of food, a black stamp in the authentic Nepalese food culture. Everyone has their go to food and well let me tell you and advice you to not base your opinions on delicious Nepalese delicacies based on any food places in the Dallas area.
Himalayan Aroma: Don't know where to start, but let's start with my order and a bit introduction to our kind of food. First I ordered dumpling also called Mo:mo is the first thing you order in a Nepalese or Tibetan restaurant. Doesn't matter if you've had it before but the magic in our dumplings are the dough and the sauce, the delicious tomato sauce. The sauce you can get in two consistencies, thin and thick. Usually thick are served in restaurants because then you can dump these small dumplings in them and take a bite. A thin consistency sauce is spread over the dumplings. The way to eat is cut open the hot dumplings with the spoon and pour in the cold sauce and savor it which is usually messy and hence they aren't served in middle to high end places but just fast food chains.  Well, the place here served thin consistency sauce in a small bowl, the plating which is mix of both and not good. Then let's carry on with the dumplings. The first reaction when I had a bite of that dumpling was that I paid for that shit. It was made on walmart dough so thin that you could taste the preservatives and I know this because I have tried making with those and always hated it. Fresh dough is the way to go and this was not the case in a place where they represent authentic Nepalese food.
Next I ordered a mutton taas. The reason is that mutton is our festive go to meat like beef is yours. We pray cows hence mutton is our go to thick flavorful meat. Mutton taas where taas means playing cards is a snack prepared to eat while playing cards during festivals. The snack should be light but flavorful, chewy and refreshing. It should normally have beaten rice or ""chiura"" as we call it which is very tasty snack to aid meat. It goes great with BBQ too. There is obviously mutton which is BBQ'd with salt, pepper and lemon to taste. It also contains fried soy-beans with some fresh onions and flavored with salt and lastly the refreshing cucumber pickle made with some cucumber, curd, pepper and salt. This is what I had my tastebuds ready for and what I got was some burnt meat, some soy-beans poorly fried and some cheap ass puffed rice and lots and lots of soy oil and they charged me 12 bucks for it which is literally stealing. This is why I am upset. This is why I am going so full on with this review because the food was basically insulting. If you're going to call yourself a Nepali restaurant then you can never screw up with at the very least those two recipes. To add to that my friend also ordered a chicken thaali which was decent home quality, not finger-licking enough for you authentic foreigner to visit this place.
You're not offending any one of us if you didn't like the food here because this is the McD representation of the food that we eat but severely overpriced. All you're gonna go is: Daf*q did I pay for?"
52,"A terrible experience. I ordered jhol-momo (chicken soup dumplings) to go and had called ahead 30 minutes. The lady on the phone had told me only 10 minutes and food will be ready. I went there 15 minutes later... Still no food! Waited 30 minutes before I could get it.. I was furious and almost wanted to leave. THe decor inside the place is horrible... Don't ever go there to dine.. It's chaotic dirty and like a shack. I had high hopes on food... The sauce was good but the momos were disgusting.big mistake to give them a chance. The only server waiting never said a word to me.. Kept looking at me and when I asked about the food she said yes it's coming.. Sure enough only 10 + minutes later it was thete.. And in between the server made her tea, drank and never bothered to offer me anything. Poor service, terrible food!"
53,"GARBAGE!!!!  NASTY. GROSS. SCARY. SCUMMY. How does the city of Irving allow such a place to serve food to human beings?!?!?! The furniture is tattered, every inch of the floor was sticky, and the place smelled - I was afraid I had stepped into a real life horror movie to be honest. I ordered a chicken dish and I've never had chicken served like that - all the bones in the meat were broken!!! Somebody needs to report this place."
54,"The only dish they had was chicken curry and thats what I ordered. I was the only customer. There were three Nepali students chilling out in one corner of the room. The order was slow and when the food came, it had a peculiar smell of either lard or old frozen meat. I did not eat the dish, instead paid the bill, with tip and left. The girl at the front counter was apologetic and wanted to pack up the dish as takeout. But I did not have the feel for this food and the restaurant. My health was prime to me and instincts guareded my decision not to eat. I do not recommend this place to anyone. The food is not safe!!"
55,"Nepalese cooking, similar to Indian and Bangladesh. Have their own specialties. Good if you want something different. Very pleasant service."
56,"Where's the Dahli Lama when you need him?
The experience: in order.
Dingy place. Tables wiped but smeary. Friday night, i'm the only customer in the place. Menu is greasy.  Menu has no description aside from postage stamp size pictures.  The waitress is almost no help.  Very little English. The best she can tell me is that some dishes are dry, others have a sauce.

I was going to go adventurous, but it seems ill advised at this point.  

I order lamb curry.  Only its not lamb. It's mutton that they ran to the market. Tough, over cooked, dried out, then put into a curry sauce.  Sauce was good, hence the 1 star.  Enough rice to feed 4.  They are out of mango lassi.  Who doesnt have yoghurt and mango pulp i ask you!  No refill on the drinks was forthcoming.  Pushed plate back when finished.  Fooled around with phone for 5 min. No check.  I go to register to check out.  Won't be back.

oh yeah. The TV is on. A cross of bollywood meets autotuner meets electrotrance music.  The worst of 2 worlds."
